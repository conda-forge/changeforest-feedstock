  summary: Classifier based non-parametric change point detection
  description: |
    Change point detection tries to identify times when the probability distribution of a
    stochastic process or time series changes. Existing methods either assume a parametric
    model for within-segment distributions or a based on ranks or distances, and thus fail
    in scenarios with reasonably large dimensionality.

    `changeforest` implements a classifier based algorithm that consistently estimates
    change points without any parametric assumptions even in high-dimensional scenarios.
    See [1] for details.
