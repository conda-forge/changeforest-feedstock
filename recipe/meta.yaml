  summary: Classifier based non-parametric change point detection
  description: |
    Change point detection aims to identify structural breaks in the probability
    distribution of a time series. Existing methods either assume a parametric model for
    within-segment distributions or are based on ranks or distances and thus fail in
    scenarios with a reasonably large dimensionality.

    `changeforest` implements a classifier-based algorithm that consistently estimates
    change points without any parametric assumptions, even in high-dimensional scenarios.
    It uses the out-of-bag probability predictions of a random forest to construct a
    classifier log-likelihood ratio that gets optimized using a computationally feasible two-step
    method.

    See [1] for details.
